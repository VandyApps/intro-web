# Intro to Web Development - Setup
### Overview

Web Development is an area of development which doesn't require very much setup, at least initially. All you need is a text editor and a browser.

For our purposes, we'll be using:

  - Visual Studio Code
  - Google Chrome

### Installation

Intro to Web Development will require [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). If you're already familiar with a (programming) text editor, go ahead and keep using it, but anybody who isn't should install VS Code.

Download and install the [latest release for your OS](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

For testing of our code and web development tools, we'll be using [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), which has great Developer Tools built in. Go ahead and install the [latest version](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html). Once again, if you're already familiar with the developer tools on another browser(such as Firefox Developer Edition), you may using it.
